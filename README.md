# DSE Scripts

## House rules
Every script/project gets its own directory.
Add a requirements.txt or use pipenv if you need dependencies.
If you have data output directories, **DO NOT COMMIT THE RESULTS** which will make a mess out of the commit history, add them to the global .gitignore (and commit the .gitignore) instead.
